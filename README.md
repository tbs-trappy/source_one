# About SOURCE ONE
## The idea
The SOURCE ONE is the first of its kind, open source collaborative frame project. It empowers the community to integrate best practices and current trends into a continuously manufactured FPV frame. The price, documentation and compatibility puts it on track to be the most accessible frame for newcomers and professionals alike.

## Changelog

### SourceOne v3
* new TopPlate, with longer Battery-strap slots - backwards compatible to V0.2
* new BatteryPad, cause of the repositioning and longer Battery-strap slots - NOT backwards compatible to V0.2
* new Cam-plate design, with Angel holes and a forward position, the Plate also contacts the 4 front Spacers for more rigidy in the front part - backwards compatible to V0.2
* Main-plate is now on top for more building room, a 20x20 (M2) mounting pattern added in the front, Antenna Zip-tie holes added - NOT backwards compatible to V.22
* 5inch Arms got a reinforcement on the outer mounting hole (backwards compatible to V.01 and V0.2)
* new Bottom-plate - NOT backwards compatible to V0.2
* changed our versioning because its sounds better (we went from v0.2 straight to v3) 

that's all changes on the Carbon and the BatteryPad. For the guys that want to mount the Battery on the bottom, i made a small 3D-batterystrap mount, that also gives the battery a flat mounting option, cause of the swap of the Center and Bottom plate. All other 3D-Printed parts will fit the Version 0.3.

## Project naming requirements
SOURCE ONE is the name of the frame. If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “TBS SOURCE ONE”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have placed as basis of the project, e.g. “TBS SOURCE ONE V0.1”. 
If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between SOURCE ONE and your project.
Accessories from the SOURCE ONE project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “TBS SOURCE ONE FPV Camera Adapter”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “TBS SOURCE ONE FPV Camera Adapter V0.1 - V2”
